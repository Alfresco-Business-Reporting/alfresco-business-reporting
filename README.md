# alfresco-business-reporting
Business Reporting should be handled by the Business. Therefore reporting should use an existing tool and plain and simple SQL. Currently, reporting in Alfresco is not that easy, and many alternatives are tech-driven. This project allows the business to use their reporting suite of choice against 'plain tables' containing your Alfresco business objects. The second feature is to generate reports against these reporting database and store the reports back into Alfresco. Reports can be designed using Pentaho Reporting. But feel free to use any BusinessObjects, Cognos, Clickview.
